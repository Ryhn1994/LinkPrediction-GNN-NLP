# Link Prediction in Social Network using GNNs
This project demonstrates link prediction in a social network using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and the Reddit comments dataset.

## Overview
This repository contains two implementations of **link prediction** in social networks. Both approaches use **BERT embeddings** and **machine learning algorithms**, with one approach additionally utilizing **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** for enhanced performance.
1. **With GNN**: Utilizes BERT embeddings and applies GNN for link prediction.
2. **Without GNN**: Utilizes BERT embeddings for link prediction.
Link prediction aims to predict the existence of links between nodes in a graph. In this project, we use user and post embeddings generated by BERT to predict new connections.

## Project Structure
- `main_with_GNN.ipynb`: Implements the link prediction model with BERT embeddings, and GNN.
- `main_without_GNN.ipynb`: Implements the link prediction model with BERT embeddings only.

## Dataset
The dataset used is Reddit comments, which includes the following columns:
- subreddit
- id
- submission_id
- body
- created_utc
- parent_id
- permalink
- token_size
- perplexity
- embeddings
