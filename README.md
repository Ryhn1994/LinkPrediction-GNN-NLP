# Link Prediction in Social Network using GNNs
This project demonstrates link prediction in a social network using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and the Reddit comments dataset.

## Overview
This repository contains two implementations of **link prediction** in social networks. Both approaches use **BERT embeddings** and **machine learning algorithms**, with one approach additionally utilizing **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** for enhanced performance.
1. **With GNN**: Utilizes BERT embeddings and applies GNN for link prediction.
2. **Without GNN**: Utilizes BERT embeddings for link prediction.
Link prediction aims to predict the existence of links between nodes in a graph. In this project, we use user and post embeddings generated by BERT to predict new connections.

## Project Structure
- `main_with_GNN.ipynb`: Implements the link prediction model with BERT embeddings, and GNN.
- `main_without_GNN.ipynb`: Implements the link prediction model with BERT embeddings only.

## Dataset
The dataset used is Reddit comments, which includes the following columns:
- subreddit
- id
- submission_id
- body
- created_utc
- parent_id
- permalink
- token_size
- perplexity

## Results
In this project, we investigated link prediction in social networks using graph neural networks (GNN) and machine learning algorithms. In this work, a combination of BERT and GNN is used to create text embeddings of posts. The results show that the combination of BERT and GNN has significantly improved the prediction accuracy and highlights the effective application of GNN in the field of NLP. These findings serve as a foundation for future research and applications in this field.
